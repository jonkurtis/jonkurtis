	<h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello there Friend!</h1>
	<p>
		I am Jon Kurtis and I am a developer/marketing manager based in Orlando, FL. I went to UCF to get my BS in Marketing. Then I taught myself to code at the University of YouTube and Wes Bos courses. 
	</p>
	<p>My thoughts on education:</p>
	<p>Teaching myself to code &gt; My BS in Marketing from UCF (Go Knights 😅)</p>
	<p>My favorite tech stack atm is:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Next JS for web apps</li>
		<li>SvelteKit or Astro for websites</li>
		<li>Supabase for BaaS (Postgres db, storage, and Auth)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>I am currently interested in programmatic SEO and building software in the Automotive industry.</p>
	<p>Mostly I work with Automotive websites, news/media websites and building internal tools to automate marketing tasks. I also manage a lot of ad spend and a team of marketers at the day job.</p>
